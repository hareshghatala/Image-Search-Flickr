# Flickr image search API using MVVM
This repository demonstrate the Flickr image search API with search endpoint and demonstrate MVVM architecture with Swift.  

This demo app contains two columned UI to disply search images. When opening the app, users can see the random image list. All images are fetched from Flickr's API with `search` endpoint. Also, it allows users to search the images as per his/her need and show past search history as well for quick search.
- Loading and error states are handled using observable closure.
- Images are cached for better performance.
- ViewModel & View bounded using swift closure.
- UI refreshed with the data update.
- Added pagination _(infinite scrolling)_ to the image lists.
- Provides history of past search terms _(latest 20 items are provided)_
